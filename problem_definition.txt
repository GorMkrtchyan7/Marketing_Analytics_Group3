At the American University of Armenia (AUA), students often deal with the challenge of strategically planning their general education cohesive clusters. They strive to align these clusters with their individual interests, academic schedules, and the specific requirements of each cluster. To address this, our goal is to develop a comprehensive guidance system that empowers students to make informed and optimal choices, ensuring their general education requirements align seamlessly with their educational aspirations and needs.
